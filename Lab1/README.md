This lab had a lot of parts, but it was mainly an intro to VHDL and programming the FPGA Board. Look at the lab1F19.pdf for a more detailed explanation. Look at the ECELab1.docx for a nice summary.
The main software used was Vivado, however since I cannot upload the whole project folders due to size limitations
I have just uploaded the vivado xpr file, and the source VHD files, as as well as any bit files. I have seperated them by project folder, as each project was set on certain tasks.
